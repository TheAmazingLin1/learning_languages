- Requirements + solutions:
    - Start and stop the game
        - Button for play 
    - Keep track of the score
        - variable cpu score and player score
    - Tracking the game state
        - create an enum x, o and unpressed and make a 2d array of that
    - Play against cpu
        - When cpu's turn look for a valid move then play it
    - Cpu cant make turn till we do and vice versa
    - Track if the game is finished
        - When a move is made check the vertical horizontal and diagonal pieces to see if it's the same. And if it is then that player hould get a point
